    <p>A child (pl. children) is a <a frem="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human">human</a> being between the stages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth">birth</a> and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty">puberty</a>,[1][2] or between the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_human_body">developmental period</a> of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant"> infancy</a> and puberty.[3] It may also refer to an unborn human being.[4][5] In English-speaking countries, the legal definition of child generally refers to a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)">minor</a>, in this case as a person younger than the local<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_majority"> age of majority</a> (there are exceptions like, for example, the consume and purchase of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"> alcoholic beverage</a> even after said age of majority[6]), regardless of their physical, mental and sexual development as biological<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult"> adults</a>.[1][7][8] Children generally have fewer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_rights"> rights</a> and responsibilities than adults. They are generally classed as unable to make serious decisions.</p>
