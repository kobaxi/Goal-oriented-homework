    <p>The BMW 6 Series is a range of grand tourers produced by BMW since 1976. It is the successor to the E9 Coupé and is currently in its fourth generation.

        The first generation BMW E24 6 Series was available solely as a two-door coupé and produced from 1976 to 1989, when it was supplanted by the larger BMW 8 Series (E31). When the 6 Series nameplate was revived in 2004 for the second generation, the BMW E63/E64 6 Series, the coupé was joined by a convertible body style. The third generation F06/F12/F13 6 Series debuted in 2011 as a coupé and convertible, and a sedan variant known as the "Gran Coupé" in 2012. When the F06/F12/F13 6 Series ended production, the "Gran Coupé"/coupé/convertible models have been shifted into the more upmarket BMW 8 Series (G15) nameplate. The fourth generation 6 Series, the G32 6 Series, debuted in mid-2017 and is offered only as a fastback body style to complement the BMW 5 Series (G30) sedan/wagon.[1][2]
        
        The first generation 6 Series was derived from the BMW E23 7 Series, and was powered by a range of naturally aspirated inline-six gasoline engines. Following generations have been powered by inline-four, V8, and V10 engines with both natural aspiration and turbocharging. Since 2008, diesel engines have been included in the 6 Series range, with four-wheel drive models on offer since 2012.[3]
